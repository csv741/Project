      <h3 id="section-header">Here's some Facts about Sir Isaac Newton</h3>

      <ul>

        <li>
          <strong>Early life</strong>
          <p>Isaac Newton was born (according to the Julian calendar, in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day,
            25 December 1642 "an hour or two after midnight", at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a
            hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire. His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before.
            Born prematurely, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have
            fit inside a quart mug. When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband,
            the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough (née
            Blythe). Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as
            revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: "Threatening my father and mother
            Smith to burn them and the house over them." Newton's mother had three children (Mary, Benjamin and Hannah)
            from her second marriage.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Middle years</strong>
          <p>Newton's work has been said "to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied." His work on
            the subject usually referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of October 1666, is now
            published among Newton's mathematical papers. The author of the manuscript De analysi per aequationes numero
            terminorum infinitas, sent by Isaac Barrow to John Collins in June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a
            letter sent to Collins in August of that year as " of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these
            things."

            Newton later became involved in a dispute with Leibniz over priority in the development of calculus (the
            Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy). Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed
            calculus independently, although with very different mathematical notations. Occasionally it has been
            suggested that Newton published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until
            1704, while Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684. Leibniz's notation and
            "differential Method", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental
            European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Later life</strong>
          <p>In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic
            interpretation of the Bible. A manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which he disputed the fidelity of 1
            John 5:7—the Johannine Comma—and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained
            unpublished until 1785.

            Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England for Cambridge University in 1689 and 1701, but
            according to some accounts his only comments were to complain about a cold draught in the chamber and
            request that the window be closed. He was, however, noted by Cambridge diarist Abraham de la Pryme to have
            rebuked students who were frightening locals by claiming that a house was haunted.

            Newton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696, a position that he had
            obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. He
            took charge of England's great recoining, trod on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower, and secured
            the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley. Newton became perhaps the
            best-known Master of the Mint upon the death of Thomas Neale in 1699, a position Newton held for the last 30
            years of his life. These appointments were intended as sinecures, but Newton took them seriously. He retired
            from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercised his authority to reform the currency and punish clippers
            and counterfeiters.

            As Warden, and afterwards as Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 percent of the coins taken
            in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the
            felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be
            extremely difficult, however, Newton proved equal to the task</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Death</strong>
          <p>Newton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20 March 1726; NS 31 March 1727). His body was
            buried in Westminster Abbey. Voltaire may have been present at his funeral. A bachelor, he had divested much
            of his estate to relatives during his last years, and died intestate. His papers went to John Conduitt and
            Catherine Barton. After his death, Newton's hair was examined and found to contain mercury, probably
            resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain Newton's eccentricity in late life.
